# FirstReactApp

<p>This is my first react app. It is a blogs website where you can add and delete blogs. Each blog has a title, a body and an author.</p>
<p>The blogs database work based on a JSON file, wich is in data/db.json. For the website to work, you must execute a node command on the terminal for the JSON server to watch that file, wich is "npx JSON-server --watch data/db.json --port 8000". Note that the last part of the command is where I select a specific port for the localhost server.</p>
